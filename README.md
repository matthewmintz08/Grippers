# Grippers

Grippers is a modern, user-friendly app designed for rock climbers who want to log and track their indoor and outdoor climbing activities. Whether you're bouldering at your local gym or tackling a challenging route on a rugged cliff, Grippers offers a seamless and intuitive way to document your climbs, monitor your progress, and share your achievements with the climbing community.
Key Features

## Why Grippers?

Existing climbing trackers like Kaya and Climbtime offer useful features, but they often fail to resonate with the unique culture of the climbing community. Grippers is built by climbers, for climbers, with a focus on simplicity, style, and community engagement. We believe that tracking your climbs should be as rewarding and enjoyable as the climbs themselves.
