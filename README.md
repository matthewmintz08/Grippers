##Why Grippers?

Existing climbing trackers like Kaya and Climbtime offer useful features, but they often fail to resonate with the unique culture and vibe of the climbing community. Grippers is built by climbers, for climbers, with a focus on simplicity, style, and community engagement. We believe that tracking your climbs should be as rewarding and enjoyable as the climbs themselves.
